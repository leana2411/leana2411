 Hi there, I'm Leana Kumari! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a third-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Full Stack Development. My skills include HTML, CSS, Java, SQL, JPA, Hibernate, and MongoDB. I've developed projects such as a Transport Management System using dependency injection and JdbcTemplate, and a Timetable Scheduler showcasing my proficiency in data structures and algorithms. Currently, during my internship at CodSoft, I've created projects like my portfolio, landing pages, and a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm still learning JavaScript and continuously brushing up my skills in data structures and algorithms. Beyond coding, I serve as the Graphics Head for the Women in Coding Club and as the Graphics and Content Creation Coordinator for the Enactus Society. Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me for collaboration or any queries. Let's create something amazing together!
